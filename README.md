# SampleSizeCalc
calculate the sample size for a client survey

An optical office has hired our services to conduct a patient satisfaction survey. Additionally, they want to evaluate the methods by which they find out about the services provided by the optician and the media in which they have seen advertising related to the brand.
The exercise is about finding the sample size 


## Concepts

## Population
The entire group that you are interested in for your study. For example, if you are surveying people in your company, the population would be all the employees in your company.

## Sample
A subset of your population. Just like a food sample, it is called a sample because it is only a taste. So if your company is too large to survey every individual, you can survey a representative sample of your population.

## Sample size
A part of a population that is representative of the population

## Confidence level
The probability that your sample size accurately reflects the greater population.
How confident you are in the survey results. For example, a 95% confidence level means that if you were to run the same survey 100 times, you would get similar results 95 of those 100 times. Confidence level is targeted before you start your study because it will affect how big your margin of error is at the end of your study. 

## Confidence interval
The range of possible values that the population’s result would be at the confidence level of the study. This range is the sample result +/- the margin of error.

## Margin of error
The maximum amount that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population.
Since a sample is used to represent a population, the sample’s results are expected to differ from what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. This difference is called the margin of error. The smaller the margin of error, the closer the results of the sample are to what the result would have been if you had surveyed the entire population. 

## Statistical power
The probability of getting meaningful results from a test.
"Statistical power can be calculated and reported for a completed experiment to comment on the confidence one might have in the conclusions drawn from the results of the study. It can also be used as a tool to estimate the number of observations or sample size required in order to detect an effect in an experiment
